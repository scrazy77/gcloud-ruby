      # ==== A note about large uploads
      #
      # You may encounter a Broken pipe (Errno::EPIPE) error when attempting to
      # upload large files. To avoid this problem, add the
      # {httpclient}[https://rubygems.org/gems/httpclient] gem to your project,
      # and the line (or lines) of configuration shown below. These lines must
      # execute after you require gcloud but before you make your first gcloud
      # connection. The first statement configures
      # {Faraday}[https://rubygems.org/gems/faraday] to use httpclient. The
      # second statement, which should only be added if you are using a version
      # of Faraday at or above 0.9.2, is a workaround for {this gzip
      # issue}[https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-ruby/issues/367].
      #
      #   require "gcloud"
      #
      #   # Use httpclient to avoid broken pipe errors with large uploads
      #   Faraday.default_adapter = :httpclient
      #
      #   # Only add the following statement if using Faraday >= 0.9.2
      #   # Override gzip middleware with no-op for httpclient
      #   Faraday::Response.register_middleware :gzip =>
